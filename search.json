    "text": "Overview\nThe purpose of this manual is to help new members and collaborators build a shared base of foundational knowledge for the kind of work we do in the Keller Lab Group. This is a collaborative, living document build with Quarto and hosted with GitHub Pages.\nThis manual details lab procedures, policies, and expectations for research group members (and may be helpful for collaborators to consult). The manual contains three sections:\n\nLab Values outlines the expectations we have for each other and ourselves to ensure a functional, healthy, and productive lab group; it is not a marketplace for Labrador Retrievers.\nOnboarding is your first stop as a new lab member (and may be helpful for others) to get your working environment and workflows set up.\nGuide is the home of our (always growing!) lab resources, how-tos, and tips for building a strong knowedge foundation for the kind of work we do in the group."

    "text": "GitHub for Puppies\nThese code blocks and recommendations can be helpful for routine tasks, but may require knowledge and set-up that they don’t explicitly acknowledge. To use these recipes well, you should work through the recommended tutorials and resources above (or have commensurate knowledge).\n\nKeep track of lab meetings\nThis is our lab meeting repo.\nThe person responsible for organizing and leading lab meetings will:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can organize this better!\n\n\n\nWe should probably have subdirectories on the main branch for each term and avoid the complicated branch structure we currently use.\n\n\n\nOnce per term, create a new branch named for the term (e.g., winter25) and update the README with the meeting details and schedule.\nOnce per term, update the main branch README.md to reflect the branch we are currently on.\nEvery week, add a new subdirectory for the meeting of that week (e.g., 1-15/) and add an agenda.md file. Include a link to the presenter’s slides if possible. Update the meeting schedule with a link to the week’s agenda.md.\n\nWe only expect other lab members to view this repo.\n\n\nContribute to the webpage\nThis is our webpage repo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may want to migrate to Quarto!\n\n\n\nThe main interactions with the webpage is to add/remove a member profile. Quarto could simplify this quite a bit, and synchronizing tech stacks for the manual and webpage could make it simpler for a wider range of contributions to each.\n\n\nThe person reponsible for maintaining the webpage should follow, and add to, the README.md as appropriate for various tasks.\nOccassionally, other lab members may want to propose changes. You can always post an Issue to the repo. If you want to directly implement changes, the workflow for this is to:\n\nClone the repo to your local machine\nCreate a new branch named parsimoniously for the change you’d like to make. For example, when we added this web manual to the navigation bar at the top of the webpage, we did the following workflow after cloning:\n\ngit checkout -b web-manual\nmade changes and tested locally\ngit add .\ngit commit -m add link to lab manual on web page resources\ngit push -u origin web-manual\nOn the web repo, open a PR with a detailed description and assign the task to Klaus and the person in charge of the webpage\n\n\n\n\nContribute to this manual\nThis is the web manual repo.\nWe need to define the workflow for contributing to it before we add more instructions here.\n\n\nSet up and maintain your research project\nIf this is your first project in the group, check out the metarepo documentation and start from the IM3 template. You should:\n\nMake keller-lab the owner\nGenerally, set the repo to private while you are first beginning your work\nClone the repo (ideally to both kasper and your local machine)\nBegin modifying the template to better meet your needs. For example:\n\nWe often add data/ to our .gitignore because we like having this in our project directory\nSome of us prefer renaming scripts/ to workflow/ because we are special\nYou may want to add other directories, .yml files, etc.,\n\n\nIf you have your own project template (e.g., maybe you like Cookiecutter Data Science), please use your template!\nNo matter how you initialize your project, please keep the following principles in mind:\n\ngit add and git commit often, and make sure your commit messages are informative (and make you feel more comfortable reverting, if necessary).\nKeep reproducibility in mind (e.g., use relative filepaths, update your README as you go, keep your kapser & local machine repos up to date with each other and make sure you can run code on both machines, etc.,)\nIn general, separate functions from analysis.\n\nStudy the UNSAFE directory structure (esp. the pyproject.toml) and see how we use it in the examples/ directory. See here\nUse software packages you develop for various functions as submodules in your analysis-focused projects. For example, see here - lab members can reach out to Adam for access if this repo is still private when they take a peek.\n\n\nCheck out our example repositories to see neat code directory structures. Reproduce these examples to see how the data gets structured for ideas on how to structure your unique project well.",

Credit: https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-dog-laying-on-grass-3039079/\n\n\n\nOur group holds the following core values (in no particular order):\n\nTransparency: We share our research process, code, data, and limitations openly. We aim to be explicit about the values-laden nature of our work. We push ourselves to communicate honestly and clearly.\nAccessibility: We aim to make our research understandable and available to both academic and public audiences. We design our shared workspaces to accommodate different needs of group members and foster an open environment in which members can confidently request accommodations.\nInclusivity: We believe the healthiest lab environment and best science happens when people with different viewpoints and experiences work together. We actively foster such an environment and aim to make the Keller Group a place where all members feel like they can completely be themselves.\nCuriosity: We crave a lab environment filled with creative ideas, questions, open exchange, and boundary pushing.\nWork-life balance: We understand that research is just one part of who we are. We maintain clear boundaries between work and personal time, and support each other in pursuing interests and commitments outside the lab.\nContributing to real-world problems: Our research is motivated by, and reponsive to, pressing societal challenges. We wish they weren’t so hard and consequential, but we love thinking about wicked problems! We strive to make meaningful impacts beyond academia. This often calls for a transdisciplinary, collaborative, and integrative approach that we all enjoy.\nExcellence: We strive for excellence in all our activities. For example, we want the paper we’re working on to be our best and we treat every talk like a job talk. We are careful, rigorous, and polished. In the words of John Wooden, “if you don’t have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?”"
